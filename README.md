# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I also choose to utilize [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for a quick and clean visual.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run webpack:dev`

Creates and bundles a manual webpack process, then hosts a small server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run webpack:build`

Creates a distributable standalone version of the manual webpack process.
